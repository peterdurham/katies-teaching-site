Magic e is a fun rule to teach through a story. The combination of using a visual with a story, helps my students to remember the rule and refer back to the story when reading magic e words!

Before teaching, make sure that your students understand the difference between short and long vowels. You can also say “does the vowel say it’s “sound” or “name”?” if easier for students to grasp.

I always supplement a lesson with lots and lots of practice. Using a variety of multi-sensory activities and games, your students will master magic e in no time! Check out the link in my bio to find this visual along with many interactive magic e activities and games!

Yes, I’m talking the good old fashion game, but what’s the secret? First of all, I haven’t met one student who’s eyes don’t light up with excitement at the sight of the bright-colored board. Second, the key is to tie learning into something fun.


This is a picture of my “Consonant Blends” version of Candy Land. On a player’s turn, the word or words are read and then they can move to the next space. This entire deck including picture cards to go along with the board are available my clicking the link in bio!


My favorite part about this game is that is never gets old! Check out my stories to find out ways that I continue to make this game FUN and EDUCATIONAL! I swear somehow it never gets old.

Finger-tapping is a great multisensory approach to use to segment or break apart a word. On left side of this worksheet is a visual model for the student to mirror. The letter boxes are intentionally on the right side of the paper so that finger-tapping and writing can be done simultaneously. Also combining this all on one worksheet helps our executive dysfuntioned kiddos stay organized!

Larger boxes are provided as a visual cue for two or three-letter blends/ digraphs.

Check out my TpT store by clicking the link in the bio. Most of my Orton-Gillingham inspired products have finger-tapping worksheets. This worksheet comes from the Consonant Blends product. Happy teaching!
